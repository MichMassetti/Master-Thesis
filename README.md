Master Thesis
=========
This repository contains my work of thesis called "Security Analysis Tools for Solidity Smart Contracts: A Comparison Based on Real-World Exploits.".
This thesis is a cross project between Politecnico di Torino and Karlsruhe Institute of Technology.

Thanks to Professor Beckert and Professor Gatteschi who had helped me during the development of of the thesis.

During this thesis, I had reviewed multiple attacks with target smart contracts, in the context of DeFi. 
The goal was to evaluate several security analysis tools, based on the exploits. 

The thesis provides a review of the attacks (how they performed) and the results obtain from the analysis with the tools. 
The research questions involve the definition of which tool could detect the most amount of attacks, how they perform, which security approch they implemented...

Thesis.pdf is the file for reading the thesis. 
Test is the directory containing some of the test I wrote for the analysis.
