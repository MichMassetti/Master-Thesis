\chapter{Outcome for individual tools}
\label{ch:Running}

This chapter is moved in the next one, I keep now bc it contains the notes

Fomal specifications, outcomes, time of running, no comparison, single description, outliers (performe very well or very baddly), 
difficulties in the installation and running 


Detalais regarding what I did for running the test, so for each tool I describe the setting for each scripts.
\subsection{SmarTest}
In some cases it takes to long so I added a timer of 320 with the setting 
no reentrancy by definition 
set up in exploit mode + assertion mode 
About Aku it gives half of the result, it states that all the user has to be refunded, but the

\subsection{Slither}
AKU: it detects the presence of arbitrary call but it doesn't detect that can get stucked 
Correct detection of all the reentrancy 
Cover: warning about the comparison based on blocktimestamp 

it has no capability for guess the other vulenrabilities 

\subsection{Mythril}

AkU: nada 
Correct detection of all the reentrancy 
Cover: warning about the comparison based on blocktimestamp 

\subsection{SolcVerify}
Notes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item inheritance allowed 
    \item it worked well with the codes (Solidity Version 7)
    \item the analysed files are still in solidity 
    \item grammar language very intuitive 
    \item it allwos even not flat contract 
\end{itemize}
It works better than Celestial 

\subsection{Celestial}
Notes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item no inheritance
    \item no struct and no array as parameter in function 
    \item total different language 
    \item more grammar for the language 
    \item A lot of grammar 
    \item no address(this), it gives error in fstar
    \item problem with internal functions , fstar could not find the identifier (BZX) 
    \item not so clear which property is violeted  
    \item no loop, neither invariant neither written
\end{itemize}

Uranium: false positive

Spartan: it works good 

bZX: about properties it worked properly, problem with internal functions 

BurgerSwap \& DirtyDogs \& SurgeProcol: no reentrancty bc Calling external contracts are avoided.
Contract Local Reasoning: Calling external contracts
can lead to reentrant behavior where the external contract
calls back into the caller, which is often difficult to reason
about. CELESTIAL disallows such behaviors by checking for
external callback freedom (ECF) [28], [42] which states that
every contract execution that contains a reentrant callback is
equivalent to some behavior with no reentrancy. When this
property holds, it is sufficient to reason about non-reentrant

Aku: it didn't work with the loop so rewrite the contract, but it worked 

Cover Protocol: celestial doesn't recognize memory and storage keyword

\subsection {Manticore}

BurgerSwap \& DirtyDogs \& SurgeProcol: no reentrancy, bc it gives always a fake positive
You can test the Reentrancy just with the tool without specification, runninng Manticore as Scanner 

Spartan: worked well
Uranium: fake positive

Aku: Worked well , it sayes that the rule about claimProject is broken just if everybid is 1 

Cover: doesn't work 
\subsection {Echidna}
Spartan: it worked correctly and it gave even the transaction oreder, tested with assertions and with test Function

Aku: worked well , it found the correct sequence of transaction for block the contract 

Uranium: it worked prorly, it gave the list of actions to do 

Cover Protocol: worked good


BZX: verified with the assertion but it woked proeprly



\subsection{Manticore}

\subsection{Certora}
The time of execution is given by the application
\subsection{Tool without Specifiction}
Mytrhil and Slither 
Slither super fast 
Mythril in case i twas too slow we put a timer of 240 seconds
A timer was add in python modifying the main caller file

\section{XSURGE on BSC Chain}   
\label{sec:Exploits:XSURGE}
The \citet{XSurgeWeb}'s whitepaper provides a presentation of the ecosystem.
It is described as a great DeFi investing idea based on proprietary pricing algorithms embedded in the Surge Token Variants' contracts.
Surge Token Variants each have their own Market Maker, allowing them to trade continuously and outlast both 
centralised and decentralised exchanges. 
The strategy is to reward long-term holding by increasing a
holder's claim of the backing asset. Each Surge Token utilizes a built-in contract exchange system that renounces the need for
a traditional liquidity pool. Both assets are stored within the contract itself, 
rather than a liquidity pool pair of the backing asset to the
token using a traditional market maker method for exchange and price calculation.

\subsection{The explpoit}
One of the Surge Token is SurgeBNB, the one which is my focus of analysis.
\citet{XSurgeBNB} explains in deep how the attack to this contract occured. 
The team claimed that the attacker had stolen \$5 million in SurgeBNB through a backdoor vulnerability.
XSURGE stated that a potential security vulnerability in the SurgeBNB contract was discovered on August 16th.

The attack is mabe by 4 main steps:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item the attacker borrow  10,000BNB through flash loans.
    \item Use all the BNB to buy SURGE. According to the current price, 
    the attacker can buy 1,896,594,328,449,690 SURGE
    \item He calls the "sell" function, for selling the obtained SURGE.
    \item The sale function alters the data after the transfer, and the transfer code has a reentrance vulnerability.
    When the attack contract acquires BNB, the period before the SURGE contract's state changes 
    (\refname{lst:SellSURGE}), the attack contract can use the reentrance 
    vulnerability to purchase SURGE again.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{lstlisting} [language={Solidity},caption={Sell function of Surge (SURGE) token.}, label={lst:SellSURGE}]
    function sell(uint256 tokenAmount) public nonReentrant returns (bool) {
        ...
        //The reentrancy 
        (bool successful,) = payable(seller).call{value: amountBNB, gas: 40000}(""); 
        if (successful) {
            // subtract full amount from sender
            _balances[seller] = _balances[seller].sub(tokenAmount, 'sender does not have this amount to sell');
            // if successful, remove tokens from supply
            _totalSupply = _totalSupply.sub(tokenAmount);
        } else {
            revert();
        }
        
        return true;
    }
\end{lstlisting}


The bnb Amount of the contract stays intact, and the total amount of SURGE tokens \texttt{totalSupply}  
has not been updated, because the attack contract spends all of the BNB balance to acquire SURGE
 each time (still remains the quantity before the sell).
As a result, the price of token falls, allowing the attacker to purchase additional SURGE. 

Repeating three times of Round 2 and Round 3 , the attacker accumulates a large amount of SURGE through reentry, and then sells all the SURGE to make a profit.

At the end of this transaction, the attack contract sold 1,864,120,345,279,610,000 SURGE, 
obtained 10327 BNB, and finally the profitable 297 BNB was sent to the attacker's address.

The following are the modifications suggested by the Beosin technical team for this attack:
\begin{itemize}
    \item any transfer operation should be place after the state changes to avoid reentry assaults.
    \item Instead of using "call. value," use transfer or send to transfer. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Properties}

This exploit represents a typical case of reentrancy. 

The attacker's strategy involves the function sell, which contains the bug, and then the function purchase. 
After calling the first one and triggering the reentrancy, the malicious fallback implemented by the attacker uses the amount of money for buying more XSURGE tokens. 
At the end of the selling process, the total supply should decrease the amount sold by the user.
But since the attacker called the purchase, the variable is not updated as it was supposed to be. 
Buying the same amount of sold tokens, the value would not change.

We define the property as a postcondition,refered to the function sell(...), which states the variable \_totalSupply is decreased of the amount sold by the user, then tokenAmount.

\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        \_totalSupply <=old\_value\_of(\_totalSupply)
    \end{split}
\end{equation}

The properties can be even expressed like a an invariant, stating that the sum of the single balances cannot exceedes the variable \_totalSupply.
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        sum_of_uint(_balances) <= _totalSupply
    \end{split}
\end{equation}
