\label{ch:Conclusion}
General overview to the research questios, new approches like Machine Learning, citining testing environment as Harhat, 
future of blockchain and adoption of solidity, different vulnerabilities regarding even the architecture itself. 
1 or 2 pages
\begin{itemize}
    \item How does a tool perform the analysis? 
    \item Which properties are relevant for smart contract security?
    \item Which ones have been violated in real-world exploits? 
    \item Which tools detect which class of vulnerabilities? 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Critical reï¬‚ection}
Our thoughs and limitation on our work. 

More language, vulnerabilities regarding Blockchain itself sybil attacks, eclipse attacks
\subsection{Outlook for further research and development}
Machine Learning, unit testing with Hardhat
